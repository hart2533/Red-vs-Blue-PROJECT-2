# Red-vs-Blue-PROJECT-2

## Unit README: Red Vs. Blue Team Project

### Unit Description

This is the second project of the unit, Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which both roles (pen-tester and SOC analyst) will be showcased. As the Red Team, an attack will happen with a vulnerable VM within our given environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, the of use Kibana will be used to review logs taken during the attack. The logs will be used to extract hard data and visualizations for the report. Then, an interpretation of the log data will suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that was successfully performed.

### This project will apply knowledge of the following skills and tools:


  - Penetration testing with Kali Linux.


  - Log and incident analysis with Kibana.


  - System hardening and configuration.


  - Reporting, documentation, and communication.


### Lab Environment
All virtual machines were located within our Microsoft Azure Lab Services.

Names of the following machines used within this project:
  - MAIN: Red vs Blue
    - Within Hyper-V Manager: Kali, Capstone, ELK
